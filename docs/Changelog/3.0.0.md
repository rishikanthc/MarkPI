## Backend Rewrite
* **Technology Shift:** The backend has been completely rewritten, moving from Python to SwellKit.
* **Database:** Transitioned from file-based management to using PocketBase for the backend database.

This version is a full rewrite of the backend in sveltekit. The choice was made as managing both
the frontend and backend using the same language and framework simplifies the architecture and
management a lot. Additionally pocketbase provides a nice `js` interface which is also nice.

## UI Enhancements
- The UI has been refined using ShadeCN, and Tailwind CSS.

## New Features
* The new version introduces support for using relative paths in wiki links and images.
* Tag Management
  * Tag Pages: Tags now get their own dedicated pages.
  * Menu Bar Icon: A new menu bar icon has been added to view the list of all tags.
* Simplified Python CLI Tool
  * The Python CLI tool has been simplified to remove most dependencies.
